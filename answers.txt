•What does fast-forward in Git mean?

If the master branch is a few commits behind any development branch, while merging these changes to the master, Git wil directly merge all of the commits in one go, instead doing it one by one.
Now master will point to the latest commit of the development branch. This will only happen if there is no merge conflict between the branches.

•Why should you have different branches?

Different branches are highly recommended because, the master should always have a working copy of the software and during development, if something happens and the master breaks, the team working will be in big trouble.
If each person had a different branch, any issues could be resolved within that particular branch and then get merged to master.

•In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

It usually depends on the size of the project. Smaller projects have just on repo, while large scale projects may have many number of repo's, each for a different version of a product.
